# Introduction

Command line client for "one click" uploads to imgur

# Secret tokens

To get the `client_id` and `client_secret` tokens, see: https://api.imgur.com/oauth2

# Usage

Copy the script somewhere in your $PATH, then you can just:

`imgur-up image.png`

It will print the direct link and open a browser towards that link.

# On first run

It will ask you to authorize it, so that images are linked to your imgur account.
